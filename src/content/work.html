    <h1>Work</h1>

    <p>I've spent most of my adult life writing freelance for startups. The most notable exception might be when I joined Compound to lead writing and help build something called the Manual.</p>

    <p>As for freelance work, I don't think the whole 'wall of logos' thing ends up being super effective. But because you're here, I might as well share.</p>

    <p>Some people I've worked with who you might be familiar with include Julian Shapiro, James Clear, and Shahed Khan. Recognizable companies might be Stripe, or Increase, or Runway.</p>

    <p>On the freelance side, I usually partner with companies to help them figure out how to talk about themselvesâ€”and then write interesting essays (and copy) only they could write. It's probably most helpful to you if I share a few things I worked on in the past ~12 months, so here are some.</p>

    <ul class="work-list">
        <li>I structured and wrote <a href="#" class="text-link">Flighty's site</a>.</li>
        <li>I worked on the <a href="#" class="text-link">Meter manifesto</a>.</li>
        <li>I worked on the <a href="#" class="text-link">Runway manifesto</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I can share plenty more, and context, over email if it seems like there's a fit to work together. Cheers.</p>
