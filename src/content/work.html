    <h1>Work</h1>

    <p>I've spent most of the last few years writing freelance for business content creators.</p>

    <p>I don't think the whole 'wall of logos' thing ends up being super effective. But because you're here, I might as well share.</p>

    <p>Some people I've worked with who you might be familiar with include Pat Walls (Starter Story), Guy Raz, and Trenton Hughes (Tribe HQ).</p>

    <p>I usually partner with companies to help them figure out how to talk about themselves â€“ and then write interesting copy only they could write. It's probably most helpful to you if I share a few things I worked on in the past ~12 months, so here are some.</p>

    <ul class="work-list">
        <li>I write emails, scripts, & social copy for <a href="https://www.starterstory.com/" class="text-link work-highlight">Starter Story</a>.</li>
        <li>I launched the <a href="https://guyraz.substack.com/" class="text-link work-highlight">Guy Raz newsletter</a></li>
        <li>I launched the <a href="https://tribe-hq-newsletter.beehiiv.com/" class="text-link work-highlight">Tribe newsletter</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I can share plenty more, and context, over email if it seems like there's a fit to work together. Cheers.</p>
