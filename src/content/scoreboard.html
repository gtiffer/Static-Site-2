        <h2>WTF?</h2>
        <p>I thought it'd be cool to have a live(ish) tracker of my writing. I feel like sometimes it's easy to say "I've written a lot" or its more evil inverse "I've barely written at all", and having something like this can both hold me accountable and reassure me that I do in fact write.</p>
