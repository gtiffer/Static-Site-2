# Welcome to My Static Site

This is a sample page created with our static site generator. Here's what you can do with it:

## Features

- Write content in Markdown
- Use front matter for metadata
- Automatically generate HTML pages
- Custom styling with CSS

## Getting Started

To create new pages, simply add `.md` files to the `src/content` directory. The build process will automatically convert them to HTML pages.
