    <h1>Hey, I'm Gus.</h1>
    
    <p>My day job is writing for founders and creators. Usually that consists of writing that helps with distribution: social media copy, YouTube scripts, newsletters, sales emails, and the like. I do plenty of other things, but this is here because most people who land on the site want to know what I do for work.</p>
    
    <p>You can choose your own adventure from here:</p>
    
    <div class="links">
        <a href="/work.html" class="text-link">[WORK I DO]</a>
        <a href="#" class="text-link">[ACCOMPLISHMENTS]</a>
        <a href="#" class="text-link green">[SCOREBOARD]</a>
    </div>
    
    <p>Cheers.</p>
