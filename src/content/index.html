    <h1>Hey, I'm Gus.</h1>
    
    <p>I help founders distribute their ideas on the internet. Usually that consists of social media copy, YouTube scripts, newsletters, sales emails, and the like. I do plenty of other things, but this is here because most people who land on the site want to know what I do for work.</p>
    
    <p>You can choose your own adventure from here:</p>
    
    <div class="adventure-links">
        <a href="/work.html">[WORK I DO]</a>
        <a href="/scoreboard.html" class="scoreboard-link">[SCOREBOARD]</a>
    </div>
    
    <p>Cheers.</p>
